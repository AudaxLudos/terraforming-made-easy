tme_agricultural_laboratory,Agricultural Laboratory,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_agricultural_laboratory.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.AgriculturalLaboratory,"Thanks to the extensive agricultural research on Gilead and Eventide, advancing agricultural science tailored to each planet can be achieved within a reasonable timeframe. From enriching soil fertility to bioengineering robust crops, this facility enables the creation and improvement of farmland on habitable planets.",,
tme_atmosphere_regulator,Atmosphere Regulator,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_atmosphere_regulator.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.AtmosphereRegulator,Massive industrial vents and pumps are built near volcanoes and underground chemical deposits. These structures are then use to carefully pump or vent material in to the atmosphere causing it to change with time.,,
tme_construction_grid,Construction Grid,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_orbital_construction.jpg,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.ConstructionGrid,"A massive orbital framework designed to serve as the foundation for large-scale engineering projects. Functioning as both scaffolding and logistical hub, it provides the structural stability, docking points, and assembly systems required for construction.",,
tme_element_synthesizer,Element Synthesizer,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_element_synthesizer.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.ElementSynthesizer,"By studying plasma furnaces and quantum-catalytic reactions, this high-end research facility pioneers methods to refine common minerals into valuable rare ores and volatile compounds. The research enables colonies to manufacture synthetic deposits that function as though they were naturally occurring.",,
tme_geomorphology_station,Geomorphology Station,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_geomorphology_station.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.GeomorphologyStation,"A planetary-scale installation capable of reshaping social and geological environments. Through methods such as irradiation, engineered plagues, induced flooding, or the introduction of invasive species, it can transform geology and biospheres to suit specific agendas. Colonies may use it to exploit resources or impose control over resistant populations.",,
tme_mineral_replicator,Mineral Replicator,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_mineral_replicator.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.MineralReplicator,"By harnessing catalytic forges and molecular synthesis, this facility develops methods to replicate common ores and organic materials from trace compounds. The research enables colonies to produce synthetic deposits that function as if they were naturally occurring.",,
tme_planetary_hologram,Planetary Hologram,20,60,,2,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_planetary_hologram.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.PlanetaryHologram,"Holographic emitters are launched into orbit around a planet, forming an interconnected net. These emitters can be calibrated to project a wide range of holographic visuals, from masking a volcanic world to appear as a lush, terran paradise to disguising a populated, habitable planet as a lifeless, barren rock.",,
tme_stellar_manufactory,Stellar Manufactory,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_stellar_manufactory.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.StellarManufactory,"An industrial complex dedicated to manufacturing parts and materials for constructing small terraforming orbital structures. From weather stations to stellar shades and mirrors, these installations are used to manipulate a planet's temperature, weather, and lighting.",,
tme_terrestrial_engine,Terrestrial Engine,100,360,,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_terrestrial_engine.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.TerrestrialEngine,"Built deep beneath the planetâ€™s surface is a network of graviton projectors and seismic regulators. These systems manipulate tectonic stresses and gravitational harmonics. By redistributing planetary mass and directing geologic energy, they can stabilize or trigger fault lines, or even alter gravitational force.",,
tme_unification_center,Unification Center,100,180,6,15,,,"structure, unraidable",,graphics/icons/industry/tme_unification_center.png,terraformingmadeeasy.industries.UnificationCenter,"A centralized government is created to unify the various polities on a colonized planet. Representatives from these polities can be directed to issue mandates to their respective populations to pursue specific goals or agendas, allowing a colony to specialize in different areas, from economic enrichment to military development.",,
